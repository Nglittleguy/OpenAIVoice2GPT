It offers a beautiful view of the Chicago skyline at night, which makes for a romantic setting. Additionally, the planetarium offers various shows and exhibitions, including stargazing and telescope observations, which can be both educational and entertaining."

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Given that the Adler Planetarium is a popular venue for both daytime and nighttime visits, the dress code is relatively casual. For a date night, I would suggest wearing something comfortable, yet slightly formal, such as a dress for women or slacks and a button-down shirt for men. It is also recommended that you bring a light jacket or sweater since the temperature can drop near the lake."
